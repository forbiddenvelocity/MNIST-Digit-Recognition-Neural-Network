# MNIST-Digit-Recognition-Neural-Network
My code on Modified National Institute of Standards and Technology Dataset, to understand how neural network works and
how deep learning fundamentally functions with a dataset of several hand-written digits. I have used the keras library and NumPy
along with matplotlib.
